## How to run

The preferred way is to use yarn instead of npm, so install yarn first (link).

1. Clone repository;

2. Run `yarn install`;

3. If installation completed successfully, run `yarn start`;

Development server already configured, so just open browser at http://localhost:8080/.

You can use "hot reloading". Just change the code, and see that page in the browser automatically updates.

> Note: If after changing code page is white (no elements), check for errors in the browser console.
